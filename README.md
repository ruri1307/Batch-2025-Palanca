# Batch-2025-Palanca

This project is a statement to the palancas that have come before it, gone are the google forms and welcome basic website hosting and tunneling on Raspberry Pi.
Through the use of HTML, CSS, and JS, the project aims to create a better palanca graphical user interface, whilst still ustilizing familiar software backend such
as google forms to handle the responses, and either openscript or python code to automatically send the palancas by email. We'll see.
