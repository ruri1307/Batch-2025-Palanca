# Batch-2025-Palanca

This project is a statement to the palancas that have come before it. Gone are the days of google forms, welcome basic website hosting and tunneling on Raspberry Pi!
Through the use of HTML, CSS, and JS, the project aims to create a better palanca graphical user interface, whilst still utilizing backend familiar to the average pisay scholar, such
as JS and Google Services interactions through Apps Script.
